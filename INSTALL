INSTALL
=======

1. You must have installed Python (with Tkinter and Cython) and gcc
2. Compile matematico.c by setup.py: python setup.py build_ext --inplace
3. Run matematico.py: python matematico.py

There is a way in Windows, too. This I maybe will write sometimes in future.
It is possible by mingw and Python. No problem :) (But it is Windows, guy doesn't
know...)
